# waifu2x-tensorrt
waifu2x-tensorrt is a TensorRT implementation of the waifu2x super-resolution model. This project aims to improve the inference speed for faster image upscaling on NVIDIA GPUs. Supports images and videos alike.

**Note**: This project is not currently under development; it will resume when I have more free time. Some features may be missing, and bugs can be expected. Contributions and feedback are welcome though!

## Installation

  Build model
```

### Building a model
Before being able to upscale an image or a video using a particular configuration, the model needs to be built into an optimized engine. To do so, use the build subcommand and specify the model, the scale, the noise, the batch size, and the tile size: 
```
waifu2x-tensorrt build --model swin_unet/art --scale 4 --noise 3 --batchSize 4 --tileSize 256
```
Depending on the configuration, this process might take a couple of minutes to complete, and TensorRT might fail if VRAM is insufficient. 

### Upscaling an image/video
To upscale an image and/or a video, use the render subcommand and specify the upscaling configuration and input files:
```
waifu2x-tensorrt render --model swin_unet/art --scale 4 --noise 3 --batchSize 4 --tileSize 256 --input path/to/file1.png path/to/file2.mp4 path/to/files
```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you decide to tackle any of these tasks or have your own ideas for improvement, please create an issue to discuss changes before submitting a pull request.
### TODO
- Add alpha support
- Add wide char support
- Add support for stream migration for video
- Add more options for video
- Further optimize render
- Add GUI
### Known bugs
- Program might not work correctly on linux/mac
- Upscaling does not tile correctly on some models when batchSize > 1
